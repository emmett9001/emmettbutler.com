                    <p>I am Emmett Butler. I grew up in the suburbs of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where I spent much of my childhood playing Nintendo 64, reading my dad’s copy of O’Reilly’s “HTML & XHTML: A Definitive Guide”, waking up early to watch music videos, and pretending to be Batman. I can at least say that I still steal my dad's technical books, and I still play an unhealthy amount of N64.
                    </p>
                    <p>I’m a big geek and an NYU student, double majoring in computer science and music technology. I try to do at least one thing every day that I didn’t know how to do when I woke up; that is, I love to learn. My computing interests include security/exploitation, operating systems, video game design/development, and Python.
                    </p>
                    <p>A huge amount of my time is spent programming, and as a result I'm always adding to <a href="gallery.php?filter=all">this pile of stuff</a>, which you should check out if you're interested in seeing what code I write looks like, for any reason. Most recently, I've done a bit of freelance web design/dev, built a twitter bot account for kicks, and I currently intern at <a href="http://parse.ly">Parse.ly</a> doing Python and Javascript development on their analytics tool for top-tier publishers. It's quite a fulfilling job.</p>
                    <p>I’m a lover of music, so obviously it bothers me when people claim to like “everything except country”. You can’t really put a person’s music taste into a box. I listen to music always - at the time of this writing I'm really into metal and chiptune. Also classic hip-hop. Also I sometimes make my own music. When I do, it’s often of the hip-hop and/or chiptune persuasion (LSDJ/Milky are my good friends). Check out the <a href="gallery.php?filter=all">gallery</a> for some examples of me being a music guy.
                    </p>
                    <p>I collect a lot of silly t-shirts, I have weird hair, I hang out in NYU CS and Music Tech a lot, and I'm generally "that guy over there with the mohawk, with headphones and a laptop, typing furiously and making strange facial expressions at his screen.
                    </p>
                    <p>If you maybe want to say hi to me/collaborate with me on a video game/just play video games, <a href="http://twitter.com/sensitiveemmett">Twitter is unquestionably your best bet</a>. Thanks for coming.
