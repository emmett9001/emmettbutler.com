    <p class="desc">The orbiting bodies are pulled toward the middle of the stationary body
    according to Newton's law of gravitation - the acceleration toward the
    stationary body is proportional to the product of the masses and inversely
    proportional to the square of the distance between them. This example also
    uses vector reflection to bounce small bodies off the surface of the large one.</p>
