                    <p>I am Emmett Butler. I grew up in the suburbs of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where I spent much of my childhood playing Nintendo 64, reading my dad’s copy of O’Reilly’s “HTML & XHTML: A Definitive Guide”, waking up early to watch music videos, and pretending to be Batman. None of these interests have left me since that time.
                    </p>
                    <p>I’m a big geek and an NYU student, double majoring in computer science and music technology. I try to do at least one thing every day that I didn’t know how to do when I woke up; that is, I love to learn. I spend most of my time programming in some capacity, whether Perl, Java, PHP, BASH, or a language I'm just learning. In my ideal world, there’s a constant stream of projects lined up ahead of me, each one involving some skill that I don’t have yet.
                    </p>
                    <p>I’m a lover of music, but it bothers me when people claim to like “everything except country”. You can’t really put a person’s music taste into a box. I listen to music very often, and I sometimes make my own as well. When I do, it’s often of the hip-hop and/or chiptune persuasion (LSDJ is my good friend). Check out the <a href="gallery.php?filter=all">gallery</a> for some examples of my work.
                    </p>
                    <p>I draw too, most often characters of my own imagining. Usually this means that they look either like dinosaurs or old video game characters, or somewhere in between. And these days, if I'm drawing, it means I'm probably animating as well, a hobby that I've recently started to develop.
                    </p>
                    <p>When I'm not staying too busy for my own good, I'm usually playing video games with my roommates or skateboarding around the east village.
